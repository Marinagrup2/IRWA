PROJECT: We start by processing the tweet data with the functions we did in the Part 1 of the Project and the evaluation from Part 2

To compare different scores, we did the 3 options, each in different sections so you can execute them individually. When executing
for our selected queries, we get 3 diferent rankings, one with the TF-IDF as we did previously, another with our own score and finally another one with the BM25.

For the second part, we have the ranking with word2vec, which implements the functions cosine_similarity and model_word2vec to generate the model so
after executing the functions, we get a new ranking for our queries


HOW TO RUN CODE: To run the code, upload the notebook to Google Drive, open it with Google Colab and execute all the cells from the beginning to the end.
